           <h2 class="ones"> You are proud as a master poet,<br/>
                Poetic soul with rhythmical intellect,<br/>
                Verse and prose comes from you imaginative wit,<br/>

                One sadden moment I read your poetry,<br/>
                Deep with significant messages, got pity with my vocabulary,<br/>
                What a wonderful legendary poem story created beautifully.<br/>
                Bravo, hooray! , , , it hooked my heart amazingly,<br/><br/>
                
                A mail links popped-up on my search out of the blue,<br/>
                Seeing with my two eyes rolling and open wide, no it can't be,<br/>
                Copy paste poetry? ? ? Can't call it your own piece,<br/>
                Not a genuine poet; with false charade and intelligence.<br/><br/>
                
                Copy paste poetry lines from the internet search out,<br/>
                Words are flowery so as lines are always with doubt,<br/>
                Lies behind the copy paste poems, it gains distrust,<br/>
                Craft your poem with honesty and integrity, please do my dear poet.<br/></h2>
